# Data Scripts
Data often get preprocessed from an original source, and many datasets come in different versions, each processed in different ways for specific purposes. This repository is meant to collect the code used to create OpenML datasets, so that they can be studied and reused.

## Contributing
Anybody is welcome to contribute. Reach out to anyone from the OpenML team to be added, or simply do a pull request.

## Guidelines:
* Create a folder per dataset name (the name used on OpenML)
* If necessary, create subfolders for different versions (the version numbers on OpenML)
* Put a link to the folder in the Wiki description of the dataset on the OpenML website, so that people may find it easily.
* Please take care to document your code, but most important is that the code is available, even if not perfectly documented.
